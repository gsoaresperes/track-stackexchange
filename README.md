# Stack Exchange Activity Tracker

My Q&A across every Stack Exchange community, refreshed weekly by [`track.py`](track.py) and stored per community under [`data/`](data/).

## Setup

Add a free [Stack Apps key](https://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register) as the `STACKEXCHANGE_KEY` repo secret. Without it the unauthenticated [quota](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/throttle) (300 requests/day per IP) throttles CI; the key raises it to 10,000/day.
